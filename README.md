# Project-A-Team-3

##### VCU, Spring 2020, CMSC 355: Software Engineer: Specification and Design.


## Project A:
Programming is hard but with practice, anyone can learn it. Novice programmers need consistent practice reading code and hand tracing       through code to understand how variables change, learn syntax, and develop problem-solving skills. This app uses daily mini-lessons to     help beginning programming students develop a regular programming practice.


## Functional requirements:
* Students create an account with a password to log into the application.
* Each registered studentâ€™s progress is stored.
* Students are given five daily mini-lessons each that can be completed in 5 - 10 minutes but must be completed on the day assigned.
* On the sixth day, a short 5 - 10 question quiz is given on the topics from the previous 5 lessons.
* On the seventh day, a record of all students who completed all 6 days is sent to the course instructor.
* If desired, a student can have a record of their progress sent to them via email.

## Build with:
* Android Studio
