# Requirements for the Project


1. Students should be able to access previous lessons. 
2. If student A downloads the app and signs up on Sunday, they start their 6-day training from then.
3. “Forgot password” prompt upon logging in for student/instructors
4. Students are able to change any of their information: address, contact number,...
5. Once a student register a course, s/he will be auto-enrolled
6. You can have a 'remember me' option. If the user doesn't check out remember me, then log out after a certain period of inactivity.
7. Each user starts and ends at their own convenience.
8. All assignments must be finished before taking a quiz. Missing each deadline should result in a penalty.
9. A student should be forced to repeat a lesson until they get it correct or pass a certain percentage
10. In case of assignments, the app strictly follows a track for a given language. 
11. The daily lessons graded. If the user gets something wrong, a hint option should be available. Grades should reduce based on whether hints are unlocked or not. One hint = 5 pts. ‘Show answer’ option takes all points off.
12. A user must watch the complete video.
13. There should be a messaging option that a student might contact with the course instructor and vice-versa.
14. An instructor should be able to update records if it is necessary. And he by default should be able to view the progress of the students.
15. The student should be able to have the app send them their progress: grades, topics they have completed, quizzes they have taken, future topics, etc.
16. An instructor may allow retakes, take decisions on point deduction, etc. By default, you may allow three retakes with a 25% deduction each time. 
17. Due tasks should add today's work. But today's work should get the first priority. By that I mean, for example, there are 5 tasks today and 2 due tasks. In one tab, you should show today's 5 tasks and in another tab, 2 due tasks. On point deduction, it depends on the instructor. In case of due tasks, an instructor may have a 75% deduction, another instructor may have a 60% deduction. 
18. Workflow: A user wants to be a Java programmer. So he starts with basic concepts. Then he gradually learns about Conditions, Loops, Arrays, Lists, etc. Afterward, he learns about Classes and Objects. Afterward, he learns harder stuff such as OOP, Exceptions, Threads, Files, etc. Once a user can learn those things, you can say that he should now be proficient in Java. The same goes for any other language. Also consider the case that besides learning syntax, language, etc, the user should also develop problem-solving skills too. 
19. If a student does not finish the assignment on the due date there should be point deductions(75%, 60%, etc up to the instructor). If an already due assignment does not finish before the weekly quiz, the student would automatically get zero on the assignment. One can take a quiz without submitting an assignment, in that case, the assignment would automatically get a zero.
20. An instructor should be able to update records if it is necessary. And he by default should be able to view the progress of the students.
21. In case of assignments, the app should follow a static track for a given language, the teacher should not be able to dynamically add material 
22. The course material should be available to students even after they complete the course 
23. The instructors should not be allowed to give students group projects, all work should be individual
24. Lessons/Courses must be taken in parallel
25. There are no minimum number of courses required 
26. The student is not required to register with a university email/class code
