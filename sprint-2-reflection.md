* The instructors should not be allowed to give students group projects, all work should be individual
* The course material should be available to students even after they complete the course
* Due tasks should add today's work. But today's work should get the first priority. By that I mean, for example, there are 5 tasks today and 2 due tasks. In one tab, you should show today's 5 tasks and in another tab, 2 due tasks. On point deduction, it depends on the instructor. In case of due tasks, an instructor may have a 75% deduction, another instructor may have a 60% deduction.
* Workflow: A user wants to be a Java programmer. So he starts with basic concepts. Then he gradually learns about Conditions, Loops, Arrays, Lists, etc. Afterward, he learns about Classes and Objects. Afterward, he learns harder stuff such as OOP, Exceptions, Threads, Files, etc. Once a user can learn those things, you can say that he should now be proficient in Java. The same goes for any other language. Also consider the case that besides learning syntax, language, etc, the user should also develop problem-solving skills too. 
* In case of assignments, the app should follow a static track for a given language, the teacher should not be able to dynamically add material 
* A student should be forced to repeat a lesson until they get it correct or pass a certain percentage



## Team Reflection:
* Pedram had worked on home page, Nate worked on lessons, Vy worked on login ,while Paul had worked on testing. 
* What worked 
* What we can carry over to sprint 3 is starting as early as possible, as starting early would operations more soother than they already are. Issues came up during break when the situation made it a bit more challenging to focus 

## Tests:
* Testing including entering data that would cause an error and checking to see if the error would be thrown
* Tests included ensuring all buttons work as they should be
* Tests if the Toast would display as espected
* This is a general overview of some of the tests executed.
