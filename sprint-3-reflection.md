## User Stories:
*   There should be a messaging option that a student might contact with the course instructor and vice-versa.
*   The student should be able to have the app send them their progress: grades, topics they have completed, quizzes they have taken, future topics, etc.
*   An instructor may allow retakes, take decisions on point deduction, etc. By default, you may allow three retakes with a 25% deduction each time.
*   If a student does not finish the assignment on the due date there should be point deductions(75%, 60%, etc up to the instructor). If an already due assignment does not finish before the weekly quiz, the student would automatically get zero on the assignment. One can take a quiz without submitting an assignment, in that case, the assignment would automatically get a zero.
*   An instructor should be able to update records if it is necessary. And he by default should be able to view the progress of the students.
*   Lessons/Courses must be taken in parallel
*   Each user starts and ends at their own convenience.
*   All assignments must be finished before taking a quiz. Missing each deadline should result in a penalty.
*   In case of assignments, the app strictly follows a track for a given language. 
*   The daily lessons graded. If the user gets something wrong, a hint option should be available. Grades should reduce based on whether hints are unlocked or not. One hint = 5 pts. ‘Show answer’ option takes all points off.
*   A user must watch the complete video.



## Team Reflection:
*   Pedram had worked on student, and teacher login, Nate had to rework on lesson due to better ideas, Vy worked on menu, and statistics ,while Paul had worked on testing. 
*   What worked 
*   What we can carry over to any sprints is that starting early, and chipping away at it in small increments is optimal. Communication is always key. 
*   We had some issues when it came to seperating teacher and student credentials, as well as some issues as to what should be on the actual lessons. With proper communication it was handled smoothly.
 

## Tests:
*   Testing including entering data that would cause an error and checking to see if the error would be thrown
*   Tests included ensuring all buttons work as they should be
*   Tests if the Toast would display as espected
*   Inputing correct and incorrect values in the lessons to match proper toast outputs
*   Testing student login on teacher login and vice versa
*   Entering incorrect/correct answers on lessons to ensure that toast displays appropriate message 
*   This is a general overview of some of the the tests executed.
