## Scrum Meetings
The team is to meet for 10 days during the two-week sprint - 5 meetings per week. You must decide on a time to record your answers to the questions and then a single commit of the day's responses is to be made into your project repository for that day.

Question    |          Person                                             | 2/26 | 2/27 | 2/28 | 2/29 | 3/1 | 3/2 | 3/3 |3/4 | 3/5 | 3/6 |

| What did you complete since the last meeting? | Vy |   I made sure all the scenarios are acceptable and drew the storyboards for all the scenarios. |  I checked with the professor and decided to use a sqlite database. I have a rough draft of the diagrams. | Finishing up the diagrams.|Done with all diagrams. | Watch sqlite with android tutorials| Make a decision on which database to use and start the login page.| Started a sample log in page.| Working on the same thing which is the first page | Still on the same thing|About to finish working on the project	
|            | Pedram |  Since last meeting I researched the requirements that were due and met with the client.| I worked on the diagrams and made corrections to the existing files. | I have started the first page and am also working on finishing the diagrams.|Finish everything with all the diagrams. | I have completed a series of lessons on working with SQLite and have also came up with a plan to work more efficiently. |  I finished looking into SQLite and also finished a big portion of algorithm |  Completed getting familiar with FireBase and also started a sample. | Still working on finishing the first page sprint and making the app run | Finished some code for the first few pages. Still working on finishing.| I have almost finished the first login page
|            | Paul |   Meet with the client to discuss details regarding sprint 1 and what is expected from us.| Talked with professor about our first meeting, and talked about UML specifications | I have worked on the UML diagram|Completed the UML diagram | reviewed some android tutorials | Reviewed tutorials about firebase | Started to look into testing | Took a look at some of the Espresso for testing|Brainstormed a few test cases | Started the process of testing
|            | Nate | I meet with the client and drew up storyboards for some of the scenarios.| Completed the uml diagram, briefly looked into sql.| Help support the UML diagram|Help finish the UML diagram | Research sqlite.| Figured out how firebase works with Android Studio.|Continued looking into firebase and working on mock app | Working on first page | Same thing | Nothing
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Vy | I will learn more about UML and other diagrams that we have to draw and research more on databases for the project.|  I will complete the diagrams with more details. | Completely done with the diagrams and roughly done with the first page.|First page of the app. | Actually start following the tutorials | Check if the login page is good to use.|Finish the sample without any errors and a working database. | Working first page of  the app| Getting everything on the first page to work|Finish the project completely
|            | Pedram |    I will research UML diagrams and Microservices diagrams.| I will work with Vy on the diagrams and also start a plan for the backlog.| I will finish the diagrams and also finish the first page.| Better understanding with databases and the activities of the first page of the app. | I will finish pseudocode and algorithm for the first sprint.| I will look into FireBase| I will try to finish the sample and complete the first sprint | I will try to finish the first page.| I will finish the login page.| I will finish the login page with authentication
|            | Paul |   Which topics about the UML diagram will be created. They are object types. | I will organize the UML diagram and work with Nate with the SQL |  I will complete the UML diagram|Plan on the next sprint | Watch SQLight with android tutorials | Check out the login page|Learn more about the testing process | I will begin to write sample tests | Look into more testing and how it works | Finish the testing process
|            | Nate | I will look into what we need to do for UML and learn about SQL.| I will look more into SQL and Firebase | Work on the UML diagram|Prepare for next sprint | No.| Nothing | Try to fix mock app. | First Page|  complete  first page|Finish sprint 
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Vy | The level of details the diagrams and the design require. | Not having enough knowledge about relational databases. | No.| No.| Keep researching | Not having enough time.| Configurations in the projects. | No |  Configuration of Android Studio.| No
|            | Pedram|   Nothing at the moment.| Only thing is understanding the relationship between components of the project.| No.| No.| We might have to adjust the way our data flow was designed.| No|Just bug with android studio and connecting all the components | No |  Connecting Firebase to all the components.|Just the errors in the firebase
|            | Paul |   Nothing, ready to get started. | Nothing at the moment.| No.| No.| No|No| Not at the moment | No | Nothing at the moment | No 
|            | Nate | No.| No.| No.| No. | No | No| No, getting firebase to fully connect. | No | No | No
| What insights have you made? |Vy| Talking with clients make it more clear on what we need to accomplish at the moment and what plans we should have on the future sprints.| sqlite is more fit to work with rather than postgresql on Android. | Not being familiar with databases stuff is a downside.|Works would be less if teamwork is better. | How to connect the database with the project | Firebase is more fit with Android Studio. Not sure in the long run it would still be good | Connecting the project with Firebase is quite easy. Downside is Firebase only allow one free database. | Not really anything| UI design takes a lot of time|Database is complicated
|            | Pedram |   After meeting with the client I was able to understand the requirements better and also more familiar with UML diagrams.| The relationships between the components are more clear and I am also more confident about how to start the sprint.| I have become more familiar with the layout of the app and have started to use SQLite to test stuff.|Teamwork is dreamwork. We should work on communication between the teammates better. |  How to make tables in a SQLite database.| How a database interacts with the code and what a relational dataBase is.Also it would be easier to use FireBase in instead of SQLite.|I am more familiar with SOA and will try to implement it in the project. | Not much|  Nothing since last meeting.|How FireBase is such a powerful SDK
|            | Paul |   Planning the structure of what seems simple is far more complex than anticipated.| Understood more the relationship with databases and our project | I have gained more experience working with the UML diagram|UML diagramming can make life a bit more smoother | Nothing to report for today | Firebase is the better choice than SQLite| I am a little more familiar with the testing process | Nothing at the moment| Testing is crucial for success | Testing is a very crucial process, must not be treated lightly 
|            | Nate | Meeting with the client has made everything a bit more focused and organized, and confirmed that we are on track with things going into the first sprint.| I found out that our main options for a database are Firebase and SQLite. | Got more hands on experience with the UML| None. | SQL vs Firebase | Firebase is better than SQLite | Found out about some issues that may come up with Firebase | None | None | None
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? | Vy | Titles of the issues should be shortened or summarized. Separating the storyboard into smaller pictures. | The diagrams will be more accurate and detailed.| No.| No. | No.| No.| No. | No.| First page will look nicer|No
|            | Pedram | Not at this time.| No.| No.| No. | We might have to adjust the way our data flow was designed.|Changing plan on the data base|Not yet. | No.| No| No
|            | Paul | More than likely, once I identify the objects needed for the UML| No. diagram, we can make adjustments to the structure of the project if needed.| Not currently| No. | No| No | No | Nope |  Once tests are ran, we will reevaluate| Not unless I test something that exposes a weakness in the software.
|            | Nate | No.| No.| No.| No.| No. | No. | No. | No.| No.| No.
