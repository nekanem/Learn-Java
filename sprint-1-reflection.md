*Testing will be completed before 3/13/20 due to an extension granted*

## User Stories:
* Forgot Password - Users will be able to reset their password by using the Forgot Password button - 
* Test Cases will be to see if the button works, but also tests to see if the updated password will be the correct credential

## Team Reflection:
* Pedram, Nate, and Vy worked on front end, database, programming the activity and app design,
while Paul had worked on testing. 
* Front end and app design relate to the appearance of the login page and the functionality (being able to type in text, get a response,).
* DataBase relates to being able to store the userâ€™s information to check if correct credentials are presented. 
* Testing relates to making sure the activity works on from all angles, meaning all the error(s) have been weaned out.
* We have accomplished a working login page that has little to no errors which was proven by test cases
* We ran into minor issues about deciding with database to go with, some light compile time errors and light testing
* What we can carry over to sprint 2 is starting early as possible, as starting early would operations more soother than they already are
