## Scrum Meetings
The team is to meet for 10 days during the two-week sprint - 5 meetings per week. You must decide on a time to record your answers to the questions and then a single commit of the day's responses is to be made into your project repository for that day.

| What did you complete since the last meeting? | Vy |   I made sure all the scenarios are acceptable and drew the storyboards for all the scenarios. |  I checked with the professor and decided to use a sqlite database. I have a rough draft of the diagrams.
|            | Pedram |   Since last meeting I researched the requirements that were due and met with the client.| I Worked on the diagrams and made corrections to the existing files.
|            | Paul |   Meet with the client to discuss details regarding sprint 1 and what is expected from us.| Talked with professor about our first meeting, and talked about UML specifications
|            | Nate | I meet with the client and drew up storyboards for some of the scenarios.| Completed the uml diagram, briefly looked into sql.
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Vy | I will learn more about UML and other diagrams that we have to draw and research more on databases for the project.|  I will complete the diagrams with more details. 
|            | Pedram |    I will research UML diagrams and Microservices diagrams.| I will work with Vy on the diagrams and also start a plan for the backlog.
|            | Paul |   Which topics about the UML diagram will be created. They are object types. | I will organize the UML diagram and work with Nate with the SQL 
|            | Nate |  I will look into what we need to do for UML and learn about SQL.|  I will look more into SQL and Firebase
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Vy | The level of details the diagrams and the design require. | Not having enough knowledge about relational databases.
|            | Pedram|   Nothing at the moment.| Only thing is understanding the relationship between components of the project.
|            | Paul |   Nothing, ready to get started.|  Nothing at the moment.
|            | Nate | No.| No.
| What insights have you made? |Vy| Talking with clients make it more clear on what we need to accomplish at the moment and what plans we should have on the future sprints.| sqlite is more fit to work with rather than postgresql on Android.
|            | Pedram |   After meeting with the client I was able to understand the requirements better and also more familiar with UML diagrams.| The relationships between the components are more clear and I am also more confident about how to start the sprint.
|            | Paul |   Planning the structure of what seems simple is far more complex than anticipated.| Understood more the relationship with databases and our project
|            | Nate | Meeting with the client has made everything a bit more focused and organized, and confirmed that we are on track with things going into the first sprint.| I found out that our main options for a database are Firebase and SQLite.
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? |Vy | Titles of the issues should be shortened or summarized. Separating the storyboard into smaller pictures. | The diagrams will be more accurate and detailed.
|            | Pedram |   Not at this time.| No.
|            | Paul |   More than likely, once I identify the objects needed for the UML diagram, we can make adjustments to the structure of the project if needed.| Not currently
|            | Nate | No.|No.
